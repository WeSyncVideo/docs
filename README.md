# WeSync

## Description

WeSync is a video streaming application that allows you to stream your videos with your friends and loved ones in perfect synchronization. One person clicks pause? It pauses for everyone! I'm sure you get the picture!

## When

Development has not yet started on WeSync, we are still doing research, gathering contributers and waiting for the right time. If you're interested in getting involved please raise an issue! :octocat:

## Goal

We know not everyone can be in the same room with their friends, family and significant others. Distance can be hard, and we want to make it a little easier for you to spend time with those most important to you. 

## Ease

WeSync is a complete rewrite of my previous application, Ease Video Player. Ease was an Electron application I build to take advantage of the `captureStream` API, which was experimental at the time. It was my first real project, and while it worked well I believe we can do far better.
